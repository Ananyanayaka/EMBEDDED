
âœ… 1. TCP/IP Protocol Suite
The TCP/IP stack has 4 layers (sometimes mapped to the 7-layer OSI model):

Layer	Protocols/Functions
Application	HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP
Transport	TCP, UDP
Internet	IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP
Network Access	Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP

ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented. Used in HTTP, HTTPS, SSH.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Faster, connectionless. Used in DNS, VoIP.

IP: Provides addressing (IPv4/IPv6) and routing.

participant "Application Layer\n(HTTP)" as App
participant "Transport Layer\n(TCP)" as TCP
participant "Internet Layer\n(IP)" as IP
participant "Network Access Layer\n(Ethernet/Wi-Fi)" as Net
participant "Physical Medium\n(Cables/Wireless)" as Phys

App -> TCP : Send HTTP Request (e.g. GET /index.html)
note right of App
Application data is passed to TCP
for reliable transport.
end note

TCP -> IP : Encapsulate in TCP Segment
note right of TCP
TCP adds headers: port numbers, sequence,
ack numbers, etc.
end note

IP -> Net : Add IP Header
note right of IP
IP handles source/destination IPs and
routing logic.
end note

Net -> Phys : Frame + Transmit Bits
note right of Net
Network interface adds MAC addresses, CRC, etc.
Transmits via Ethernet/Wi-Fi.
end note

Phys -> Phys : Physical transmission
note right of Phys
Bits are transmitted over copper, fiber, or air.
end note

Phys -> Net : Receive Bits
Net -> IP : Extract IP Packet
IP -> TCP : Extract TCP Segment
TCP -> App : Deliver HTTP Request

note right of App
Remote server receives the HTTP request.
Process continues in reverse for response.
